<h1>Hipster Ex-Boyfriend's Chicken Liver Pate</h1>
<img src="/recipes.html/rustic-pate.jpg" alt="Rustic Pate with Mushrooms and Fennel"></img>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Chicken liver, 1 cup</li>
    <li>Shitake mushrooms, 1 cup</li>
    <li>Shallot, med</li>
    <li>Fennel bulb (fronds too), med</li>
    <li>White wine or Sherry, 1 cup</li>
    <li>Grass-fed butter, 1/2 cup or more</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Pull off the fennel fronds, mince them, then chop and dice bulb. Save the fronds for the liver, and the bulb for the shitake. Mince the shallots.</li>
    <li>Prepare the liver by pulling and removing the tough connective tissue with a paring knife from liver and throw away. Try not too cross-contaminate the vegetables by using a separate area.</li>
    <li>Prepare two pans. In one, cook shitake mushrooms, shallots and fennel bulb for 6-8 minutes on med-high heat, using half(!) the wine to cook the mushrooms until they've released most of their moisture. Mince mushroom-fennel-shallot mixture and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cook liver on medium heat. Add the fennel fronds, and use remaining wine on liver. Let the alcohol steam off uncovered and be careful not to overcook the liver! It's very delicate and cooks very quickly.</li>
    <li>The liver should be medium rare, pink inside, almost(!) bloody in the middle, as they keep cooking when transferred to cutting board. If you can take a large knife and use it to smear the liver into a smooth consistency on the cutting board, you've cooked it right. If the liver texture is dark and grainy, pilting up like an old wool sweater, you've overcooked it. Itâ€™ll take more chopping than smearing in this case. The consistency should be smooth and buttery. Adding plenty butter will of course help with that.</li>
    <li>Continue to smear the rest of the liver into a paste, and then chop/fold in the mushroom-fennel mix and a generous amount of butter. The heat of the recently cooked mushroom and fennel and the residual heat of the liver melts the butter, and the butter in turn stops the liver from over-cooking. Timing is key here, as always.</li>
    <li>Eat immediately or cover and refrigerate for later consumption. Lasts about three days, maybe a week. Enjoy with a fresh baguette, some crackers, or a few.</li>
