    <h1>Cha Caramel</h1>
    <h2>a.k.a. Pork Dice</h2>

    <h3>Caramelized and Peppered Cha Pork Dice</h3>
        <h5>A peppery, sweet and savory pork dish prepared by Mom, in which she caramelizes sugar and soy sauce to coat evenly diced and browned, crispy-edged pork sausage. She mixes in a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper as a finishing touch. The pepper’s heat with the sweet and salty umami is the signature flavor profile of this classic home favorite, “Cha Caramel,” said in my mothers particular Vietnamese accent with a Montrealean-French flair. All ingredients are in 1:1 ratios so it’s a super simple dish, quick and delicious over rice. Not exactly the best for you but certainly a filling comfort food that always hits the spot.</h5>


    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Cha (1 lb), a vietnamese pork sausage, light tan brown with fine consistency, often wrapped in banana leaves. They often come in 1 lb  banana-leaf capsules about 3x6” diameter x length. Chopped into centimeter cubes (3/8in).</li>
                <li>2 tbs oil, my mom likes avocado oil, but any is plain vegetable oil is fine.</li>
                <li>2 tbs Sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbs Fish Sauce (any vietnamese or thai variety is fine. Try “3 crabs” brand you find in a viet store or an asian market.</li>
                <li>2 cloves Crushed garlic</li>
                <li>Plenty of Cracked pepper, venture two tablespoons!</li>
            </ul>
        </h5>

    <h4>Method</h4>
        <h5>Remove banana leaf (or sometimes plastic wrap or both), and dice up the pork into centimeter cubes.
            In a medium sauce pot, distribute the oil and sugar in the pan by shaking it close to the flame, medium heat to medium-low (no higher because sugar burns at 210 degrees). Heat sugar until carmelized, then add fish sauce and garlic.
            Mix in diced cha, shake the pot until everything is coated and well-browned. Try to limit contact with sauce while stirring, mixing just by touching the pork, and not the sauce when its at the bottom of the pan.
